# The Dusty Temple

Builds a bit on the [Wasteland Temple](./../wasteland-temple) model (at the time I had this idea that I was going to have a whole series of different temples). 

The focus here is on modeling and, in this case, providing a believable volumetric environment using a 3D noise texture.
