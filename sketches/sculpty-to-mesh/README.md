# Sculpty to Mesh

One of the things that I have never been good at, but also don't seem to have the patience to learn is 3D sculpting. In a moment of questionable inspiration I realized but I could just use silly putty to create the shapes that I wanted, scan them using my phone and use those scans to populate a 3d world. 

Any self-respecting 3d sculptor would likely scoff at the idea, but it sure was fun.
